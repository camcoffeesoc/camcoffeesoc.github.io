    <p>We are a Society within the University of Cambridge hoping to unite students through love of teas and coffees. We will give members a chance to try new varieties and brew methods, as well as a chance to promote improving mental health and wellbeing. It is a great way to escape from studies, to take an hour off to speak with friends and make new ones! We are really excited to expand this community with your membership. </p>
    <p>We believe that tea and coffee represent more than just a beverage, as the ritual behind pausing your workflow to make these drinks allows you to take a small but important break from your busy day.</p>
    <div>
      <p>We believe education surrounding ethical and sustainable production of coffee and tea is also massively important and is applicable to many other products too. We promote choosing to spend the little extra to ensure an improved quality of life for the farmers and workers within the supply chain.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
		<p>We have many exciting sponsorship partners such as <a href="https://www.nichecoffee.co.uk/">Niche Coffee</a>, <a href="https://www.aeropress.co.uk/">AeroPress</a> and <a href="https://1zpresso.coffee/">1zpresso</a> with hopes to work with more companies within industry in the future! We will host interesting and unique events such as AeroPress championships, frequent socials, social swaps, cupping events and coffee tournaments </p>
